        <h2>The Céarôn</h2>
        <p>
          In days long past, before the Land of Death had people and animals in
          it, there was one being existing alone, called <i>Ichéarôn</i> “The
          Crone”. Being the first being, she was tall and epic. She was taller
          that any giant could hope to be. Being the first being, her coat was
          incredibly pure, the whitest white with no trace or hint of anything
          that isn't white. In such old days the land wasn't like it is today.
          There was mountains where we now have seas and seas where we now have
          mountains. Ichéarôn shaped the world. She made valleys by carving the
          land with her hands, filled with stones. She tipped her hands upside
          down, causing the land that was in her grasp to fall, creating the
          mountains. <br />
          Then she had a thought to make our land. While she was in Norway, she
          lifted many stones and lots of soil with her hands in she carried that
          huge chunk of earth across the North Sea. While she was walking she
          dropped some of the stones in the sea, creating the islands. Then she
          dropped all of the soil and created Scotland. Then she graced Scotland
          with meadows, with valleys, with rivers and islands in the rivers,
          with small slopes, with hills, with knolls, with great river valleys,
          with ravines, with streams, with lakes, with hill slopes, with
          summits, with hillfoots, with mountain passes, with narrow hill
          passes, with caves, with waterfalls, with bogs, with mudflats, with
          beaches, with small dips in the land, with rolling green hills, with
          easturies and with small knolls. After making Scotland, Ichéarôn
          bathed in the sea. Her epic size caused the water to swirl as a
          whirlpool in a stormy dance. She disturbed the sea so much that it
          never stopped swirling, even today the water is dancing yet in a
          circle. When she got out, she took off her soaked white cloak and she
          threw it flat over Scotland to let it dry. By doing this she caused
          the land to be covered in a deep white layer and so she made the first
          snow.
        </p>

        <h2>Birth of Ighidfóch</h2>

        <p>
          After the land was given a form, there was still no other beings
          except for Ichéarôn. The land was too dry for any life to survive.
          There was no forests or rivers. So Ichéarôn dropped a water drop from
          the sky and it fell to the land, then she dropped another one, and
          then more and more until there was a great flood and the dry land
          became a wet and graced land. At the place where the first drop
          landed, a tree grew from the ground and it grew tall. The tree was
          <i>Cébhurm</i> “he who is a tree trunk”, Ichéarôns husband. Cébhurm
          grew until his branches tapped the sky. When he was done growing,
          Cébhurm made two seeds on two of his branches. The seeds fell to the
          ground and broke open. A man came out from one of the seeds and a
          woman came out from the other. They were <i>Scañsem</i> “he who is
          shining” and <i>Fúfer</i> “she who is prosperous”.They were the most
          beautiful beings to have such a form. They mated and so Fúfer became
          pregnant. Not long after she gave birth to a plethora of children.
          many became isílechuiarq and many become ighidfóch.
          <i>Isílechuiarq</i> “the holy court” had no physical bodies, they
          danced in the air, happy and invisible…except when they create their
          sacred flashes of light. Isílechuiarq have such a righteous
          consciousness. <br />

          <i>Ighidfóch</i> “the good people” were born as dwarves, little with
          brown and leathery skin. Disgusting little creatures, angry and
          deformed. Despite being small, they are incredibly strong, too strong
          for a man to fight. As well as isílechuiarq and ighidfóch, Fúfer had
          another child called <i>Ibhlechmn</i> “the black man”. He has the form
          of a man's shadow, living in the forests where he hunts children,
          burning their houses and killing their families with a divine
          sickness. <br />

          There also was <i>Iquhijqwijfe</i> "the White Woman", with bright
          white skin, white clothes and white hair. A beautiful woman, the white
          light danced off her skin. Her pretty image was not a hint of her
          disposition because she attacks travellers during the night. She
          frightens them with wails at a distance before killing them.<br />

          Þurws Iquhijqwijfe ano, awijfe we ibriht quhijq huio, iquhijq clés in
          iquhijq haar. Abhóne wijfe, iquhijq lihts ijdañsn af ihuiler. Ursónse

          iniht. Iféar schísijghíniq qeðm we igýons gínrðm abhé afór þiq
          schísijchionðm.<br />

          With isílechuiarq living in the air and Ibhlechmn living in the
          forests, ighidfóch built villages and they lived there happily. For a
          long time they made great swords, spears, shields and other beautiful
          objects until another creature came…humans…our ancestors. Our
          ancestors wanted to live in the land so they fought ighidfóch. After
          many bloody battles and wars our ancestors won against ighidfóch.
          After the war they agreed that the humans would live on the land while
          ighidfóch would live underground. But not all of them lived
          underground, a few intended to live alone in forests and old ruins,
          surviving by killing people and dipping their hats in their blood so
          that they don't die, and so they became
          <i>iridbniqs</i> “the red hats”
        </p>

        <h2>Honest Thomas</h2>

        <p>
          Long long after our ancestors seized the land from ighidfóch, there
          was a man called Tamis. He was a lord of his land and he was a
          righteous man. He loved nature so when one spring day when the sun was
          shining and the birds were singing, he couldn't help but sit under the
          trees. The day was so sweet and beautiful that he slept under the
          trees. He woke up when he heard a horse in the forest. He searched for
          the horse and when he found it, he saw the most beautiful and fairest
          woman riding it. Tamis walked up to her and asked if he could kiss
          her. She said yes and she lowered her head and her lips touched his.
          But while they were kissing she changed her form. Her blonde hair
          became thin and grey, her soft white skin became old and wrinkled.
          There was no sweet girl left anymore…just <i>Isílechélah</i> “the old
          holy woman”, queen of <i>Eofn</i> ("the other world"). <br />
          This disgusting sight made Tamis jump back with a painful shudder.
          With an evil voice Isílechélah told Tamis that because he kissed her,
          he must go with her to live as her slave. Tamis’s soul crumbled but he
          couldn't run away from Isílechélah. So he mounted her horse. The horse
          then ran through the forest and down into a tunnel. The tunnel was so
          long that no light could reach iy, and there was water up to the
          horse’s knees. After a long time in the tunnel they exited it. Now
          they were in Eofn, a beautiful and bright land. Tamis looked at
          Isílechélah and she became a beautiful woman again. She told Tamis to
          sit and that she would return soon. She also told him that he mustn't
          speak to anyone until she returned. So he sat on a bench and waited
          for Isílechélah. After three days without speaking to anyone, the
          queen returned. She told Tamis that an epic and evil enemy was coming
          to Eofn to fight and that she didn't want Tamis to die. So she and
          Tamis rode her horse back to the Land of Death so he would be safe.
          When he was home Isílechélah told him that even how only three days
          passed in Eofn, seven years had passed in the Land of Death. She felt
          sorrow for Tamis so she gave a magic ability to Tamis. She made it so
          that Tamis could never lie and that he could foresee the future, and
          that he would never die. After this he got a new name…<i
