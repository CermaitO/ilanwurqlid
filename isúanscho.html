      <p>
        The letters <b>x</b> and <b>z</b> are not used even when writing foreign
        loanwords: <b>sijlafón</b> "xylophone" and <b>síbra</b> "zebra".
      </p>

      <p>
        The letter yogh <b>ȝ</b> (capital: <b>Ȝ</b>) can be used as an
        alternative for <b>j</b> when font support allows for it. So the word
        <b>qijara</b> "to earn" could also be spelled as <b>qiȝara</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>Pronunciation</h2>

      <p>
        Lanwurq has a very shallow orthography (spelling) which means that it is
        written as it is pronounced and pronounced as it is written. There are
        no exceptions, spelling irregularities or silent letters. As such the
        way a word is written will give you a reliable idea of how to pronounce
        it.
      </p>

      <h3>Vowels</h3>

      <p>
        Even among Germanic languages, Lanwurq has a very rich vowel inventory.
        Vowels can occur as oral vowels (vowels which have no nasalization) or
        as nasal vowels (vowels which are pronounced with airflow through the
        nasal cavity). The nasal forms are indicated in writing by placing a
        <b>ñ</b> after the vowel: <b>scañsn</b> "shining", <b>qecheñ</b> "to
        know", <b>qeiñghe</b> "to enter". The guide below will list the IPA
        pronunciation followed by an attempt to explain the sound in relation to
        English.
      </p>

      <div class="pronunciation-table">
        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">a</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [a] or like the "a" in English "father". Example:
            <b>aqurcaq</b> "spider". When <b>a</b> occurs after another vowel
            and before the consonants <b>m, n</b> or <b>r</b> then it is
            pronounced as a schwa [ə], or like the "a" in English "ago".
            Example: <b>stúar</b> "battle".
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">e</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [e̞] as in English "pay" but it is not a diphthong
            unlike in English. Example: <b>qebren</b> "to burn"
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">é</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [ɪ] as in English "pin". Example: <b>géq</b> "road,
            path, street"
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">i</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced is pronounced [ɜ] or like a shorter version of
            <b>ir</b> as in British English "bird". Examples: <b>itase</b> "the
            cup", <b>gin</b> "if".
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">í</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">

        </div>

          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [o̞] as in English "go" but with a slightly lower
            vowel. Example: <b>cor</b> "calves", <b>fron</b> "stubborn". When
            <b>o</b> occurs after another vowel within a morpheme boundary (that
            is, within the same word) then it is pronounced the same as <b>ô</b>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">ó</p>

          <p class="letter-sound">ô</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [o̙]. English has no equivalent to this sound but like
            the English "o" in "go" but with the root of the tongue retracted
            further back in the mouth. Examples: <b>iôn</b> "the waterfall".
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">u</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [ʌ] as in English "gun". Example: <b>qeluqng</b> "to
            cling, to huddle, to lie low". An exception is when the letter is
            part of the trigraph <b>quh</b> which will be explained below.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">ú</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [ɵ]. English doesn't have this sound but it is
            pronounced like <b>i</b> but with more rounded lips. Examples:
            <b>upfrú</b> "inland", <b>blúam</b> "flower".
          </p>
        </div>

          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [ɵ̞], like <b>ú</b> but with the tongue lowered
            slightly. Examples: <b>suin</b> "soon", <b>stuio</b> "chair".

        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">y</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [ə], a schwa as in the "a" in English "ago". This only
            occurs between the letters r and m. Examples: <b>warym</b> "warm",
            <b>féarym</b> "farm, <b>éarym</b> "arm".

        The rest of the diphthongs are those which end in <b>-o</b>. This is especially true of <b>o</b> which is not pronounced like "oo" in English but as <b>o</b> followed by an <b>w</b>. The post-vocalic <b>o</b> is also pronounced like a <b>w</b> when after <b>u</b>.

    <p>
        Lanwurw vowels can freely occur in a hiatus, meaning that they can occur beside each other without needing an intervening consonant to keep them separate but also without becoming diphthongs. Vowel hiatuses mostly occur across morpheme boundaries (meaning where a prefix or suffix meets with a stem). Hiatuses can contain 2-3 vowels at a time. When a vowel is within a hiatus it's pronunciation doesn't change at all. Some examples of hiatuses are <b>eiiojn</b> (e-i-iojn) "of the bad one", <b>qeeeq</b> (qe-e-eq) "to have eaten", <b>aéarq</b> (a-éarq) "a place".

      <h3>Consonants</h3>

      <div class="pronunciation-table">

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">b, d, f, g, m, n, s, v, w</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">are pronounced as in English. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">bh</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">is pronounced [β], similar to English "v" but if made with the lower lip against the upper lip instead of applying the lower teeth to the upper lip: e.g <b>nebh</b> "nose".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">c</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">is pronounced as [kʰ] as in the "k" of English "kill". It is never pronounced as an "s" in any instance: e.g <b>sarc</b> "shirt".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">ch</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">around /a/ is pronounced [ç], like the "hu" in English "human" or "hue". When around the vowels <b>i, í, é, e, ú, ui</b> it is pronounced fronter in the mouth as [ɕ], almost like the "sh" sound in English but with the blade of the tongue just behind the alveolar ridge in the mouth. When around the vowels <b>u, o, ó, oñ</b> it is pronounced [x] like in Scottish English "loch". When it is surrounded by vowels of both types, its pronunciation is determined by the following vowel: <b>ichóre</b> [ɜ́xùre̞ː] "the mountain hollow". When this sound occurs after an "s" it is spelled as <b>s'ch</b> to avoid ambiguity with <b>sch</b>. When after a nasal vowel it is always pronounced as [ç]: <b>mañche</b> [mã̀xéː] "filthy, dirty".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">h</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">at the beginning of a stem is pronounced, even when prefixes and proclitics are added [h]: <b>qehén</b> "to gather", <b>húle</b> "strong wind", <b>adnehodiq</b> "I wouldn't hold it". When at the end of a syllable it is pronounced as [χ], like the "ch" in Scottish English "loch" but pronounced further back in the mouth: e.g <b>qegraloh</b> "to gut". When inbetween two vowels or before "m" and "n" [x] is spelled as <b>hh</b> to distinguish it from [h].</p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">dj</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">is pronounced as [d͡ʒ], like "dg" in English "bridge": e.g <b>gadje</b> "guy, fellow".
