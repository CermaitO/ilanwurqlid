      <p>
        The letters <b>x</b> and <b>z</b> are not used even when writing foreign
        loanwords: <b id="sijlafon">sijlafón</b> "xylophone" and <b id="sibra">síbra</b> "zebra".
      </p>

      <p>
        The letter yogh <b>ȝ</b> (capital: <b>Ȝ</b>) can be used as an
        alternative for <b>j</b> when font support allows for it. So the word
        <b id="qijara">qijara</b> "to earn" could also be spelled as <b>qiȝara</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vowel letters with diacritics represent different vowel qualities entirely, rather than stress. below are some examples of words that are almost identical apart from the pronunciation of the vowel.

        <h4>Capitalization</h4>

        <p>
          The rules of capitalisation are not too distinct from English with some minor differences. When a noun with a capital letter has the definite article clitic <i>i-</i> "the" or the indefinite article <i>a-</i> "a, an", the article is not capitalised rather the first letter of the noun itself is: <b>aDíd mns héarnpóq aúf efnqjn</b> rather than <b>Adíd mns héarnpóq aúf efnqjn</b> and <b>iLijn iqstonníd cwéq</b> and <b> Ilijn iqstonníd cwéq</b>.
        </p>
      

      <h2>Pronunciation</h2>

      <p>
        Lanwurq has a very shallow orthography (spelling) which means that it is
        written as it is pronounced and pronounced as it is written. There are
        no exceptions, spelling irregularities or silent letters. As such the
        way a word is written will give you a reliable idea of how to pronounce
        it.
      </p>

      <h3>Vowels</h3>

      <p>
        Even among Germanic languages, Lanwurq has a very rich vowel inventory.
        Vowels can occur as oral vowels (vowels which have no nasalization) or
        as nasal vowels (vowels which are pronounced with airflow through the
        nasal cavity). The nasal forms are indicated in writing by placing a
        <b>ñ</b> after the vowel: <b>scañsn</b> "shining", <b>qecheñ</b> "to
        know", <b>qeiñghe</b> "to enter". The guide below will list the IPA
        pronunciation followed by an attempt to explain the sound in relation to
        English.

          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [a] or like the "a" in English "father". Example:
            <b>aqurcaq</b> "spider". When <b>a</b> occurs after another vowel
            and before the consonants <b>m, n</b> or <b>r</b> then it is
            pronounced as a schwa [ə], or like the "a" in English "ago".
            Example: <b>stúar</b> "battle".
          </p>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">e</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [e̞] as in English "pay" but it is not a diphthong
            unlike in English. Example: <b>qebren</b> "to burn"

        </div>

        <div class="letter-container">
          <p class="letter-sound">i</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced is pronounced [ɜ] or like a shorter version of
            <b>ir</b> as in British English "bird". Examples: <b>itase</b> "the

          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [o̞] as in English "go" but with a slightly lower
            vowel. Example: <b>cor</b> "calves", <b>fron</b> "stubborn". When
            <b>o</b> occurs after another vowel within a morpheme boundary (that
            is, within the same word) then it is pronounced the same as <b>ô</b>
          </p>

          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [o̙]. English has no equivalent to this sound but like
            the English "o" in "go" but with the root of the tongue retracted
            further back in the mouth. Examples: <b>iôn</b> "the waterfall".
          </p>
        </div>

          <p class="letter-sound">u</p>

            part of the trigraph <b>quh</b> which will be explained below.

          <p class="sound-explanation">
            is pronounced [ɵ]. English doesn't have this sound but it is
            pronounced like <b>i</b> but with more rounded lips. Examples:

          </p>

          <p class="letter-sound">y</p>
          <p class="sound-explanation">

        Lanwurq vowels can freely occur in a hiatus, meaning that they can occur beside each other without needing an intervening consonant to keep them separate but also without becoming diphthongs. Vowel hiatuses mostly occur across morpheme boundaries (meaning where a prefix or suffix meets with a stem). Hiatuses can contain 2-3 vowels at a time. When a vowel is within a hiatus it's pronunciation doesn't change at all. Some examples of hiatuses are <b>eiiojn</b> (e-i-iojn) "of the bad one", <b>qeeeq</b> (qe-e-eq) "to have eaten", <b>aéarq</b> (a-éarq) "a place". 
    </p>

    <h4>Vowel Length</h4>

    <p>
      Length is not marked at all in writing as it is fairly predictable. Lanwurq obeys the Scottish Vowel Length Rule which states that vowels are long before the voiced fricatives <b>v</b> and <b>ð</b>, before <b>r</b>. The vowels <b>u</b> and <b>ý</b> do <u>not</u> lengthen in these environments. If there is a schwa (spelled as <b>a</b>) between a vowel and <b>r</b>, the first vowel is lengthened but the schwa remains short.
    </p>

    <ul class="centering">
      <li><b>scr<u>ív</u>ur</b> "writer, author"</li>
      <li><b>gr<u>av</u>iq</b> "scarf"</li>
      <li><b>qet<u>óv</u></b> "to soar"</li>
      <li><b>br<u>eð</u>ur</b> "brother"</li>
      <li><b>qer<u>éð</u>ur</b> "to prefer"</li>
      <li><b>g<u>é</u>a<u>r</u></b> "braid, pleat"</li>
      <li><b>b<u>ór</u></b> "hole"</li>
      <li><b>l<u>aver</u>óch</b> "lark"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Vowels are long when at the end of a word (though the suffix <b>-mi</b> has a word final short vowel), although such lengthened vowels remain long even when affixes are added rendering the vowel no longer word final. The vowel <b>o</b>, when after another vowel, and the nasal vowel <b>oñ</b> can never be long.
    </p>

    <ul class="centering">
      <li><b>g<u>ú</u></b> "gull, seabird"</li>
      <li><b>qijar<u>a</u></b> "to earn"</li>
      <li><b>tas<u>e</u></b> "cup"</li>
      <li><b>wid<u>a</u></b> "widow"</li>
      <li><b>upfr<u>ú</u></b> "inland"</li>
      <li><b>gum<u>oñ</u></b> "indistinct" - short vowel</li>
      <li><b>gý<u>o</u></b> "narrow pass between hills" - short vowel </li>
      <li><b>buicsch<u>o</u></b> "library" - long vowel, as the <b>o</b> is not after a vowel</li>
    </ul>


    <p>
      A few words are identical except for that one word has a short vowel while the other has a long one. This usually happens when a word, ending in a vowel (thus a long vowel), takes on a suffix and so happens to resemble another word with a short vowel.

    </ul>


      <p>Lanwurq also has long vowels before word final syllabic nasals, in such cases the vowel <b>u</b> can be long: <b class="ben">ben</b> "through", <b>jung</b> "young", <b>hém</b> "home". When a suffix is attached to such words, the nasal ceases being syllabic and the vowel shortend:
    </p>

    <ul class="centering">
      <li><b>jung</b> "young" > <b>jungur</b> "younger"</li>
      <li><b>sauing</b> "song" > <b>sangs</b> "songs"</li>

      <li><b>sém</b> "fat, lard" > <b>séme</b> "fat"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The vowel in the verbal proclitic <b>ad-</b> "I would" is long: <b>adwurs</b> "I would win". It is also long in the verbal proclitic <b>id-</b> "it would".</p>

    <h4>Low Central Vowel Dropping</h4>

    <p>
      Low Central Vowel Dropping (LCVD) is the process where the vowels <b>i</b> and <b>u</b> are dropped in certain conditions. LCVD occurs in words which begin in a consonant or a consonant cluster (except if the consonant is <b>r</b> or <b>n</b>) followed by <b>i</b> or <b>u</b> followed by a syllable final nasal. When a prefix (or proclitic) is attached to such a word, the vowels <b>i</b> and <b>u</b> drop entirely, usually leaving the nasal consonant (<b>m, n, ng</b>) behind it to become syllabic. If the prefix or proclitic would typically cause lenition on the initial consonant then the lenition will happen despite being directly followed by the nasal: <b>sin</b> "son} → <b>isn</b> "the son", <b>schpin</b> "spoon" → <b>ischpn</b> "the spoon", <b>binane</b> "banana" → <b>mabhnane</b> "my banana", <b>-binc-</b> "to press down" → <b>aobnc</b> "I will press down", <b>in</b> "in" → <b>ewsn</b> "he was in", <b>-cum-</b> "come" → <b>wuocm</b> "we will come", <b>unca</b> "weird" → <b>'snca</b> "it is weird", <b>min</b> "man" → <b>imn</b> "the man". If the consonant before the dropped vowel is <b>l</b>, then this process will cause it to become <b>ô</b>b>: <b>lum</b> "chimney" → <b>iôm</b> "the chimney".<br>

This rule still applies even when the proclitic is not directly attached to the noun, such as when it attaches to the adjective instead: <b>ighid sn</b> "the good son", <b>imache schpn</b> "the dirty spoon", <b>majela bhnane</b> "my yellow banana", <b>aonó bnc</b> "I will not press down", <b>ewsnó n</b> "he wasn't in", <b>ito ôm</b> "the tall chimney", <b>wuonó cm</b> "we won't come".

    <h4>Geminated Consonants</h4>

    <p>Sometimes consonants can become geminated (pronounced twice as long) at morpheme boundaries. This is represented by writing the same consonant twice: <b>nístte</b> "next to", <b>erracst</b> "over stretched", <b>qebagge</b> "to return (to a place)", <b>qebhaggí</b> "to return an item, to give back", <b>baggon</b> "decline" and <b>qebhaccm</b> "to come back".</p>

    <p>Some examples where a consonant being long or not is a distinguishing feature.</p>

    <ul class="center">
      <li><b>adé</b> "commotion" vs <b>addé</b> "I would do"</li>
      <li><b>idrinc</b> "alcohol" vs <b>iddrinc</b> "it would drink"</li>
   
    </ul>

    <h4>Syllabic Consonants</h4>

    <p>In Lanwurq there are certain consonants which can behave quite like vowels in that they can form a syllable in themselves. The consonants <b>m, n, ng, r, s</b> can become syllabic. They become syllabic when between two consonants: e.g <b>iqóqmd</b> "it opened", <b>aqsrlíd</b> "she has just left". They can become syllabic when word final, even after a vowel (with the exception of <b>r</b>): <b>óm</b> "air", <b>qeóqm</b> "to open", <b>én</b> "breath", <b>sívn</b> "seven", <b>lauing</b> "long", <b>ísmaqng</b> "he is making". When the syllabic consonant is after a vowel and word final, it is rendered non-syllabic by the presence of a suffix: <b>óms</b> "air" (gen). </p>

    <h4>Lenition</h4>

    <p>
      There is a phonetic process called lenition, which in the context of Lanwurq, refers to how the consonants <b>p, b, c, g</b> become <b>ph, bh, ch, gh</b> in certain conditions. When a consonant undergoes this change it is said to lenite. When <b>p, b, c, g</b> occur after a vowel, or a vowel followed by <b>s</b>, they lenite, this is best observed with the application of a prefix ending in a vowel, such as the definite article <b>i-</b> "the":</p>
      
      <ul class="centering">
        <li><b>paarqn</b> "crab" > <b>iphaarqn</b> "the crab"</li>
        <li><b>biqoñ</b> "mallet" > <b>ibhiqoñ</b> "the mallet"</li>
        <li><b>cast</b> "appearance" > <b>ichast</b> "the appearance"</li>
        <li><b>géq</b> "road" > <b>ighéq</b> "the road"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        An exception to this is if the vowel is <b>o</b> (when it is after another vowel) which blocks lenition: <b>ao<u>p</u>uiar, bio<u>b</u>e, io<u>c</u>a, ao<u>g</u>ar</b> "I will pour, shelter, each, I will cause".
      </p>

      <p>When another consonant follows <b>p, b, c, g</b> it prevents lenition from happening. So if a word ends in a lenited consonants, the application of a suffix beginning in a consonant causes the lenited consonant to unlenite. This is best seen with the plural suffix <b>-s</b>: <b>éch</b> "oak" → <b>écs</b> "oaks". An exception to this is if the consonant is <b>l</b> which does not block lenition: <b>ébhlins</b> "maybe".

       <ul class="centering">
        <li><b>bríd</b> "bread" > <b>ibríd</b> "the bread"</li>
        <li><b>prían</b> "needle" > <b>iprían</b> "the needle"</li>
        <li><b>cro</b> "cow" > <b>icro</b> "the crow"</li>
        <li><b>grú</b> "horror" > <b>igrú</b> "the horror"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the following examples the plural suffix causes the final consonants to unlenite, if the suffix is begins in /s/ then the final consonant will devoice also:</p>

       <ul class="centering">
        <li><b>nebh</b> "nose" > <b>neps</b> "noses"</li>
        <li><b>buich</b> "book" > <b>buics</b> "books"</li>
        <li><b>bagh</b> "bag" > <b>bacs</b> "bags"</li>
      </ul>

<p>
  Word final <b>p</b> often becomes the glottal stop <b>q</b>. This <b>q</b> lenites in the same manner as <b>p</b>, becoming <b>ph</b>: <b>naq</b> "knee" > <b>inaphemi</b> "my knee".
</p>

<p>In general lenition is restricted to within word boundaries, but adjectives ending in vowels can trigger lenition on their noun: <b>bódrin</b> "cat" → <b>wí bhodrin</b> "small cat".</p>

<p>
  The lenited forms of the velar plosives <b>c</b> /kʰ/ and <b>g</b> /g/ have several realisations depending on the surrounding vowels, if the preceding vowel is front (<b>i, í, e, é</b>) or central (<b>ú, ui, i, ý</b>) then they will be realised as [ɕ] and [ʑ]: <b>qesích</b> [ʔé̞sìɕ] "to search, to find", <b>stégh</b> [stʰɪ̀ʑ] "stag", <b>qebhigh</b> [ʔé̞βɜ̀ʑ] "to build" and <b>drúchiq</b> [drɵ̀ɕɜ́ʔ] "wet, soaked". If the preceding vowel is <b>a</b> /a/ then they will lenite as the true palatals [ç] and [ʝ]: <b>bach</b> [bàç] "back" and <b>bagh</b> [bàʝ] "bag". If the preceding vowel is back (<b>u, o, ó</b>) then they will lenite as [x] and [ɣ]: <b>móghur</b> [muɣʌr] "despite" and <b>dugh</b> [dʌ̀ɣ] "dog".
</p>

<p>
  Lenition will also occur when followed by /Vs/ such as in <b>is bhuich</b> "this book" and <b>íschíqng</b> "he is peering". This is due to the sound change which brought about lenition being conditioned like this: p, b, k, g → ɸ β ç ʝ/V(s)_(V)(ʟ). The lenition itself seems mostly confined to word boundaries with clitics and affixes triggering lenition in some alternations, auxiliaries and particles don't trigger lenition due to being unbound morphemes: <b>ísnó cíqng</b> "he isn't peering". When <b>sc</b> is lenited to <b>s'ch</b> it is spelled <b>s'ch</b> to avoid confusion with <b>sch</b> which is pronounced as in English "shoe": <b>Scóqs banur</b> "Scottish flag" > <b>iS'chóqs banur</b> "the Scottish flag".
</p>

<p>
  There is a secondary lenition process called "D-lenition" which is when <b>d</b> becomes <b>ð</b> when before <b>m</b>: <b>schilód</b> "she loved" → <b>schilóðm</b> "she loved him". 
</p>




      
    <h3>Pitch accent</h3>

    <p>
      Unlike many European languages, Lanwurq does not bear any stress at all, each syllable is pronounced for roughly the same amount of time. This makes Lanwurq a syllable-timed language as opposed to a stress-timed one. Instead of stress, Lanwurq has a pitch accent system. There are two tones which are high (H) and low (L). No syllable has its tone set in stone. Rather the two tones can shift along a word depending on which kind of word it is (noun, adjective, verb) and what affixes are attached to the word. Typically a stem has two tones with the pattern HL or LH (HH or LL is not permitted). However with the addition of affixes a single word can bear several accented syllables. If the word ends in a syllabic consonant, then that consonant will bear a tone also which will be the opposite tone of the tone in the preceding syllable. Note that here I will use Ø to stand for an unaccented syllable. Words like prepositions, or function words like conjunctions and intensifiers bear no pitch at all: <b>abhún</b> (ØØ) "above", <b>biq</b> (Ø) "but, although, however", <b>féar</b> (ØØ) "quite". </p>

<p>
      Within nouns and adjectives there are two possible pitch patterns which are HL or LH. The most common pattern is for a noun to have the LH pattern (or just L if the noun is monosyllabic) where the first syllable has a low tone and the second syllable has a high tone: <b>duiar</b> (LH) "door", <b class="hon">hon</b> (LHL). When a prefix is attached to these words then the high tone falls on the prefix and a low tone falls on the first syllable of the word, with following syllables being unaccented:  <b>iduiar</b> (HLØ) "the door", <b>ihon</b> (HLØØ) "the hand".</p>

<p>Nouns and adjectives with the HL patterns bear the high tone on the first syllable and the low tone on the second syllable (or just H if the noun is monosyllabic). This is the more marked pattern as the first vowel in the noun/adjective must be long or before a glottal stop.</p>

<p>If a glottal stop is after the first vowel then this will cause a noun to have the HL pattern: <b>fiq</b> (H) "foot", <b>aqurcaq</b> (HLØ) "spider". When the first vowel is long then both the high and low vowel will fall on the long vowel: <b>bórah</b> (HL) "group", <b>féður</b> (HL) "father".<br>
When a prefix is attached to these words then the high tone falls on the prefix and the low tone falls on the first syllable of the word, with following syllables being unaccented: <b>ifiq</b> (HL) "the foot", <b>ibhórah</b> (HLØ) "the group", <b>iaqurcaq</b> (HLØØ) "the spider". If yet another prefix is applied then the high tone will fall on the leftmost prefix and the low tone will fall on the next prefix, with the noun bearing no tone: <b>eibhórah</b> (HLØØ) "of the group".</p>

<p>Within verbs there is a different pattern. In all verbs the first syllable of the verb stem always has the low tone no matter what. Verbal prefixes have no inherent tone, rather their
tone is assigned by how far away they are from the beginning of the verb. If the prefix is directly attached to the verb then it gains the high tone: <b>-dañs</b> "dance" (L) → <b>qedañs</b> (HL) "to dance" → <b>qeedañst</b> (LHL) "to have danced} → <b>aowañqeedañst</b> (LHLHL) "I will want to have danced". Note that no matter how long the prefixes string on, there will always be a low tone on the first syllable of the verb.</p>

<p>Person marking suffixes stand out in that they do have an inherent tone which is H. Even if there are unaccented syllables sitting between the first syllable of the verb and the person marking suffix, the person marking suffix will have a high tone regardless: <b>agralohtiq</b> (HLØH) "I gutted it". </p>

<p>If the verb stem is monosyllabic and ends in a vowel, then the vowel will actually be two vowels of the same quality but with different tones in a LH pattern, this is true even if the verb bears prefixes: <b>qedé</b> (HLH) "to do", <b>qefo</b> (HLH) "to fall", <b>qecheñ</b> (HLH) "to know".</p>

<h4>Fixed Pitch</h4>

<p>The Fixed Pitch pattern consists of monosyllabic and polysyllabic words which have a low tone on the first syllable of the stem and a high tone on the second syllable (in polysyllabic words). It is named Fixed Pitch as the pitches do not shift when modifiers are attached:</p>

<ul class="centering">
<li><b>hús</b> "house" > <b>ihús</b> "the house"</li>
<li><b>tód</b> "fox" > <b>itód</b> "the fox"</li>
</ul>

<p>Polysyllabic words which have a low pitch on their first syllable and a high pitch on the second syllable will lose the high pitch on the second syllable when a modifier is attached:</p>

<ul class="centering">
<li><b>féður</b> "father" > <b>iféður</b> "the father"</li>
<li><b>duiar</b> "door" > <b>iduiar</b> "the door"</li>
<li><b class="hon">hon</b> "hand" > <b>ihon</b> "the hand"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Shifting Pitch</h4>

<p>
  The Shifting Pitch pattern consists of monosyllabic and polysyllabic words which have a high pitch on the first syllable of the stem and low pitch on the second syllable (in polysyllabic words). I named this pattern Shifting Pitch as the pitches shift when modifiers are attached, more specifically the pitch shifts one syllable to the left, for example when used with the definite proclitic i the high tone shifts to i and the low tone to the first syllable of the stem and the second syllable continues to go lower than the first syllable:
</p>

<ul class="centering">
<li><b>fiq</b> "foot" > <b>ifiq</b> "the foot"</li>
<li><b>bórah</b> "group" > <b>ibhórah</b> "the group"</li>
<li><b>aqurqaq</b> "spider" > <b>iaqurqaq</b> "the spider"</li>
</ul>


<h4>Origin of Pitch Accent</h4>

<p>
  The pitch accent of Focurc appears to have originated of an earlier stress timed system (which is still widely found among Scots dialects). A hypothesis is that the vast majority of words belong to the "Fixed Pitch" pattern with the low pitch on the initial syllable of the stem. It seems that Focurc turned stressed syllables into syllables with low pitch and the preceding unstressed syllable became a syllable with high pitch:
</p>

<p class="centering">σ1[+stress]σ2[-stress] → σ1[+high]σ2[+low]</p>

<p>This however doesn't explain how the "Shifting Pitch" pattern arose, perhaps there are more complex environments which caused the Shifting Pitch pattern to begin in a high pitch which haven't yet been identified. Coming from a stress timed system would also explain why function words such as conjunctions, auxiliaries, prepositions etc don't have any pitch as surrounding dialects which retain a stress timed system tend not to place stress on these words and it is fair to say that North-Mid didn't either when it had a stress timed system, and if these words never had stress then they never would have gained pitch either according to the above change.</p>

<p>It also appears that North-Mid Scots shifted stress onto proclitics instead of stressing only the stem. In the shift from North-Mid C to Focurc these stressed proclitics took the high pitch with the initial syllable of the stem taking the low pitch. It is this that caused the pitch to shift when a clitic is attached as shown above in the Shifting Stress section. North-Mid Cstarted to turn determiners (in this case the definite article) into proclitics and shifted the stress onto the proclitics which would later affect the pitch placement.</p>

<p>
  All of the previous examples have shown how the pitch placement of nouns can be affected by proclitics but verbs undergo the very same thing as Focurc has verbal proclitics. The verbal proclitics (which will be discussed later on in this book) are subject pronouns. These verbal proclitics always take the high tone and cause the initial syllable of the verb stem to take the low pitch, however verb endings always take a high pitch meaning that a verb can have three syllables with pitch (provided that the verb ending is made up of a vowel followed by a consonant, or just a syllabic consonant) which is unlike nouns and adjectives which can only take two syllables with pitch.
</p>

<ul class="centering">
<li><b>qescrív</b> "to write" > <b>amscrívn</b> "I am writing"</li>
<li><b>qefliq</b> "to move" > <b>amfliqn</b> "I am moving"</li>
</ul>

<p>When the future tense interrogative proclitic o/ô- is attached to a proclitic pronoun it takes a low pitch. The reason for this is unlikely to be do to the previous stress system as this proclitic formed when the pitch accent was already in place. Rather it takes a low pitch as the next syllable it attaches to always has a high pitch and Focurc doesn't allow two adjacent syllables to have the same pitch. To avoid this clash the future tense interrogative proclitic always takes a low pitch: <b>oñascrív?</b> "will I write?"</p>
    

    <h3>Ur + Je = Ije</h3>

    <p>When <b>ur</b> and <b>je</b> come into contact they both merge into the sequence <b>ije</b>. This can be seen in the vocative case with nouns ending in <b>-ur</b> and the singular imperative for verbs ending in <b>-ur</b>.</p>

    <ul class="centering">
      <li><b>breður</b> "brother" > <b>breðije</b> "O, brother"</li>
      <li><b>qeleður</b> "to beat" > <b>deñ leðijem</b> "don't beat him!"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Allophony</h3>

    <p>
      Here are further notes about allophonic processes; how sounds change around other sounds.
    </p>

    <ul class="centering">

      <li>The velar lateral <b>l</b> [ʟ] can only occur in the begining of a syllable and never at the end. Sound changes vocalised earlier syllable final <b>l</b> into <b>-o, ô, -oñ</b>.</li>

      <li>The trill /r/ is pronounced as a tap [ɾ] between vowels, and there is free variation with [ɾ] elsewhere: <b>rúd</b> "pole, christian cross, beam, rod", <b>qewére</b>  "to make use of, to utilize, to employ" and <b>qewurs</b>  "to win a fight, to beat someone in a fight, to outdo, to surpass"</li>

      <li>The clusters /(s)tr/ and /(s)dr/ are realised as dental [(s̪)t̪əɾ̪] and [(s̪)d̪əɾ̪]: <b>streht</b> "straight", <b>tróh</b> "trough"</li>

      <li>
        The pronunciation of <b>s</b> as /s/ is in free variation with [s̺]: <b>scúar</b> or <b>scúar</b> "whip"
      </li>

      <li>When /t/ occurs before the nasal consonants /m n ŋ/, /t/ becomes a geminate version of whatever nasal follows/: <b>amiht</b> ("I might") > <b>amihnne</b> ("I might not"), <b>esníst</b> "he attacked" > <b>esnísmmi</b> "he attacked me"</li>

      <li>When /Vʔ/ comes before /d/ (even across word boundaries), the glottal stop is dropped leaving a long vowel: <b>iq-</b> ("third person neuter") + <b>-d-</b> ("conditional clitic") + <b>ge</b> ("go") = <b>idge</b> [ɜ́ɜ̀dgeː] "it would go".</li>

      <li>Around front and central vowels, the affricates /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/ palatalise to [t͡ɕ] [d͡ʑ]. Similarly the clusters /t͡ʃj/ and /d͡ʒj/ are [t͡ɕ] [d͡ʑ]: <b>gadje</b> [gàd͡ʑéː] "guy, fellow", <b>tchijní</b> [t͡ɕɜ̀i̯níː] "chinese" and <b>tchúhtur</b> "rough rural man".</li>

      <li>The alveolar plosive /d/ becomes /ð] when before /m/: <b>iq-</b> "third person neuter prclitic" + <b>-d-</b> "conditional clitic" + <b>-mn-</b> "epistemic clitic" + <b>ge</b> "go" > <b>iðmnge</b> [ɜ́ɜ̀ðmń̩gèː] "it would have to go".</li>

      <li>Voiced plosives devoice to unaspirated unvoiced plosives before /s/ and /ʃ/: <b>bód</b> [bùd] "rabbit" > <b>bóts</b> [bùts] "rabbits", <b>wurd</b> [wʌ̀rd] "word" + <b>-scho</b> "collection suffix" > <b>wurtscho</b> [wʌ̀rtʃóː] "dictionary".</li>

      <li>All word final nasals are syllabic: <b>óm</b> [úùḿ̩] "air, haze".</li>

      <li>The vowels <b>i u</b> /ɜ ʌ/ do not occur word finally. Word final <b>í</b> /i/ is rare on nouns but it does occur in a handful of words such as <b>í</b> "eye", <b>bliní</b> "dogfish", <b>lí</b> "meadow". Word final <b>i</b> /ɜ/ does occur but only very rarely in the verb <b>qebhi</b> "to be" and the suffix <b>-mi</b>.</li>

      <li>The vowels <b>a é i</b> become <b>aui éui iui</b> when before a word final velar nasal <b>ng</b>. When a suffix renders the nasal non-final, the vowels revert back to <b>a é i</b>:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>sauing</b> "song" (<b>sangs</b> "song")</li>
          <li><b>dwauing</b> "toil, labour" (<b>idwangoñ</b> "the labour will")</li>
          <li><b>qefauing</b> "to catch, to seize, to capture, to grasp, to conquer, to imprison, to acquire" (<b>fangur</b> "conqueror")</li>
          <li><b>lauing</b> "long" (<b>langist</b> "longest")</li>
          <li><b>réuing</b> "ring" (<b>réngs</b> "rings")</li>
          <li><b>hiuing</b> "thing" (<b>hings</b> "things")</li>
          <li><b>qebhiuing</b> "to dump, to pile" (<b>bingn</b> "piling up")</li>
          <li><b>qediuing</b> "to bash" (<b>adngiqiq</b> "I bashed it")</li>
          <li><b>qehiuing</b> "to hang" (<b>hingn</b> "hanging")</li>
          

        </ul>
    </ul>
